# Loom

Loom is a model checker for concurrent Rust code. It exhaustively explores the
behaviors of code under the C11 memory model, which Rust inherits.

## Limitations

While already very useful, loom is in its early stages and has a number of
limitations.

* Execution is slow (#5).
* The full C11 memory model is not implemented (#6).
* No fence support (#7).
